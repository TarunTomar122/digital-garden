### The beginning

Google recently released the newest memeber of the Gemma family of models, a very tiny 270M parameter model. My initial reaction was that this is too small to be useful. I was super skeptical. So much so I shit posted a bit on twitter.

Got a few replies telling me that I was wrong. These models are quite useful for when you want to finetune a model on a specific task. 

####

But as you know I don't just go around believing everything I read on the internet. So I decided to finetune this to see if it could actually be any useful lol. 

### What to finetune it on?

Then I got into this whole rabbit hole of figuring out what to finetune it on. I mean ofcs if I just wanna do it for the purpose of learning, I could take any existing dataset from huggingface and then finetune it on that. 

####

To be fair that won't even take more than 10 minutes as unsloth provides the entire pipeline on google colab to do that. 

####

But I wanted to do something personal. Something that can make me confident about the usability of these models. So I thought and thought for a while. 

####

Some of the obvious choices were:

####

- Finetuning it to act like a personal agent and then merge it with "Lumi" to give lumi superpowers.
- Finetuning it to auto tag my notes in "Lumi" to make it more useful.
- Finetuning it to act like a "cat" and just say cat stuff.
etc. etc.

####

**But my favorite one was to finetune it to roast my runs on strava :)**

### The how?

This part is rather simple tbh. 

####

I started by download the entire dataset of my runs on strava. (Thank god strava allows you to do that)

#### 

Then I used Gemini flash to create summaries of my runs. I intentionally kept the personality a bit rude and sarcastic. So that the model would be able to roast me. 

####

After these two steps I had a dataset of 200+ runs that looked like this:

```javascript
{
"input": 
    {
        "date": "2024-01-07", 
        "activity": "Run", 
        "distance_km": 3.08, 
        "pace": "5:54/km", 
        "elevation_gain_m": 4, 
        "recent_runs": 
            [
                {"distance_km": 3.06, "pace": "6:14/km"},
                {"distance_km": 3.04, "pace": "6:01/km"}
            ]
    },
"output": 
    {
        "summary": 
            "Another short 3km run completed. 
            The pace shows minor improvement, but remains uninspiring.", 
        "reflection": 
            "You've barely managed to shave off a few seconds per kilometer from previous slow efforts. 
            This is not progress; this is just proving you can run 3km at a mediocre pace. 
            Focus on real speed."
    }
}
```

###

Then I used unsloth with google colab to finetune the model on this dataset. It only took like 5 minutes to do this whole thing. A huge shoutout to chatgpt for helping me figure out the right set of LoRAs and also finetuning the model.

Below is the customized code for finetuning the model.

####

```python
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,
    eval_dataset = None, # Can set up evaluation!
    args = SFTConfig(
        dataset_text_field = "text",
        per_device_train_batch_size = 8,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 1, # Use GA to mimic batch size!
        warmup_steps = 5,
        num_train_epochs = 5, # Set this for 1 full training run.
        learning_rate = 2e-5, # Reduce to 2e-5 for long training runs
        logging_steps = 1,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        weight_decay = 0.01,
        lr_scheduler_type = "linear",
        seed = 3407,
        output_dir="outputs",
        report_to = "none", # Use this for WandB etc
    ),
)
```

###

Once done, it was time to test it out. Here's a sample response:

```javascript   
{
    "summary": "You ran 5.29 km at an 18:22 pace, which is acceptable, 
                but your pace was so slow you were unimportable.", 
    "reflection": "This pace is a tad slow for your form today. You need to work on your form."
}
```

Not bad for a model that I can run locally on my phone eh? This was so quick and easy to do that I am wondering if I should finetune a version of this model for each of my personal usecases and create a fleet of Gemma models that will run locally on my phone whenever I need them. 

####

I am sorry Google. I was not familiar with your game. I hope this article makes up for it.

PS: Here's the google colab [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pwAkDF5Q5J9EVt01GUMrqS0DhI_dqn0V?usp=sharing) if you want to try it out yourself.
