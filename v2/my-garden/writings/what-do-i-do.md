### Ranting starts

Whenever somebody asked me about my plans for the future and career, I would always say something like this - 
####

> It's only been 18 months at Adobe for me. I am yet to get promoted and then I might think of switching and moving to some other company maybe. But also since Pari is so smol right now I wanna be around her and that means I have to stay in Noida only and since we don't have a lot of companies in Noida... my options are limited and thus I think I will stay in Adobe for the next 2 years too.

####

It's not a shit plan! Atleast that's how I was evaluating this in my head... Until

####

I talked to people. I talked to people about my career related stuff. And what they all said was basically 

####

**maybe... just maybe... I feel comfortable and so I don't want to think of getting out of this comfort zone and so im trying to justify everything with Pari and family and everything else.** 

####

The first thought that came to my mind when they said all this stuff was - **You're stupid and that's not true**

####

The second thought however was - **hmmmm maybe you do make some sense**

####

So I slept on all these thoughts and now that I am slightly more coherent let me talk about my career.

### More ranting (but this is about career)

I am due for promotion next year in January hopefully if everything goes right. If that happens then I'll be moving to being a P20 Developer instead of a P10. I'd hopefully be getting some salary hike (anywhere around 10-20%) and I'll also be getting some bonus (maybe?)

####

After this I don't see myself getting promoted by being in the same company before another 2 years atleast. And the way it works in tech is that unless you're promoted or you switch, your increments are very low (subjectively). 

####

**But I wanna earn more! I'm 23 right now... I can do more**

#### 

And so for me switching after 6 months of getting promoted seems like the sweet spot honestly. I'd also be completing my 2 years at adobe and as they say **the best time to switch from your first job is after 2 years and before 3 years.**

####

With these thoughts in mind I realised I should consider looking for other oppurtunities in the second half of next year.
Now the real problem starts.


####

> I can not stay in noida and switch because there's like only 2 companies in Noida lol. And I don't wanna go and live in Blr permanently. 

####

That's where the idea of moving out of India to some other nicer place (preferably EU) came to my mind. I've always wanted to spend some years in EU and I've always dreamt of living some part of my life in those cool Nordic Countries (norway, sweden, finland etc.).

####

**This probably is my best shot at living my dream**

####

And so I wanna consider switching my job and moving to EU next year. 

#### 

Then when I'm working there, I can consider taking a break after 1 or 2 years and I can do MS in CSE and then switch to some research related roles maybe. That's a bit far stretched goal but it's a goal.

####

Let's go... ig?
