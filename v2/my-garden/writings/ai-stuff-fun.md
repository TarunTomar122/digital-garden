### The beginning

It all began about a month ago—when I first laid eyes on Cursor. There was an undeniable spark, a magnetic pull that drew me in. The moment I discovered Cursor, it felt like fate. I was so enchanted that I even wrote a [blog](https://www.tarat.space/writings/cursor-ai) about this miraculous encounter.

####

I was mesmerized by its promise: a composer feature that could take my raw ideas, transform them into tangible code, execute commands, and breathe life into my projects.

### The initial jitters

The early days were filled with a heady mix of excitement and uncertainty. I dove into my work with Cursor by my side, coding with a speed and passion I had never known before. Yet, as with every new romance, there were moments of unease.

####

At times, Cursor's code wasn’t what I expected.

####

I was used to writing code in a way that I understood it. I knew what I was doing. I knew what I was writing. But cursor was not doing that. It was writing code in a way that I didn't understand.

####


But because I don't give up so easily I decided to try and give it my best shot. I kept using it for more and more projects every single day. Hoping that we'd get better at it.

### The honeymoon phase

And then, miraculously, things started to click. In just two weeks, Cursor and I transformed from hesitant collaborators into an unstoppable duo. Together, we achieved what I once thought was impossible:

####

- Updated UI of my [digital garden](https://github.com/TarunTomar122/digital-garden/commit/d55549fdfdeb187c03962042726b51c29ade5878)
- [Added a like button to my blogs](https://github.com/TarunTomar122/digital-garden/commit/639fd6d7e802c72bebcf66632fa5265c0d9ebaec)
- Made a stupid trip planner project - [Map My Trip](https://www.tarat.space/projects/trip-planner)
- Made shit ton amount of progress on [Project Nimbus](https://www.tarat.space/projects/ood)
- Figured out how to run Qwen 14b on my local machine
- Created an api using websockets to stream in the model output in real time
- Figured out how to run Stable Diffusion on my local machine
- Created [a custom inference api for Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/TarunTomar122/stable-diffusion-inference-module)


####

All of these things were done in a span of less than 2 weeks and btw if you forgot I do have a full time job that takes up most of my time 5 days a week every week.

####

Every achievement felt like a shared victory—a testament to what two minds, human and AI, could accomplish together. I was floating on cloud nine, deeply in love with the magic we created.

####

All I had to do was **accept** the differences between the two of us and how we worked.

(i wrote that twice yes. because it sounded cool hehe)

### The conflict

But, as every passionate affair eventually reveals, the honeymoon phase was not destined to last forever.

####

Small conflicts began to emerge. Cursor’s output, once a source of endless wonder, started to falter. Commands that once executed flawlessly became tangled lines of code. I found myself repeating instructions, growing increasingly frustrated as our once seamless collaboration stumbled.

####

I was getting frustrated. I was getting annoyed. I was getting angry. I was getting upset.

####

But there was nothing I could do about it. 

####

The code was not working anymore. The projects were stuck. Cursor was stuck. At this point it needed me to do something.

####

#### But that's when it hit me. **I had no fucking idea how this code worked.**

(because I didn't write it. Cursor did.)

### The realization

Standing at the crossroads, I saw clearly that something had to change. Our once passionate collaboration had spiraled into a toxic cycle.

####

In my quest to harness Cursor’s capabilities, I had allowed it to do the heavy lifting without understanding the foundation of our work. The brilliance of our early days had dimmed under the weight of complexity and neglect.

### The guilt

Hi, it's me. I am the problem it's me. 

####

I had to face the music. The fault wasn’t solely Cursor’s—it was mine.

#### 

Cursor didn't choose to do all these things itself. It was me. I made it do all these things and now that nothing was working I couldn't blame cursor for all of it.

####

It was a humbling realization. I had to take full responsibility for the unraveling of our creative bond.

####

And so that's exactly what I did.

### The happy ending (for now)

In that moment of despair, a spark of resolve ignited within me. I decided that our relationship wasn’t meant to end—it was simply at a crossroads. I would not let this partnership with Cursor slip into oblivion.

####

From now on, I would dive deep into the code. I would learn its language, understand its quirks, and ultimately, harness its potential more wisely. 

####

**Cursor would remain my partner, but the onus of creation and responsibility would be shared. I wouldn’t accept its output blindly—I’d review, understand, and improve it.**

####

I know I messed up but I am ready to do the work. I am ready to learn. I am ready to grow. I am ready to be better.

####

Our journey isn’t over. In fact, it’s just beginning a new chapter—a chapter where growth, accountability, and mutual understanding pave the way for a brighter, more harmonious future.

####

Yours,

Tarat
