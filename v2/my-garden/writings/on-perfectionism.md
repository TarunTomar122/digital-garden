For the longest time in my life, I was scared of putting my work out there for everyone to judge because I always believed my work had to be perfect to share.

> Bullshit.

That was a load of bullshit.

When I am trying hard to be perfect, I stop enjoying the creative process and instead, I become too focused on the outcome and the result.
Which is stupid if you ask me because making art is supposed to be fun.

####
>Nowadays I set the bar very low, especially at the beginning of my creative process, cz that gives me the freedom to explore new ideas and challenge the norms.

####
And that's when I enjoy making art the most.

So yeah, don't chase perfectionism enjoy the flow of creativity instead ‚ù§
