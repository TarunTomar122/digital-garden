So I recently came across [this](https://huyenchip.com/list-100/) article by [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/) where she made a list of 100 things she wants to do before _ahem_ you know she dies.

And I found it pretty interesting and now I want to try and create such a list for myself but I’m not too fond of the word **death** so I’m calling it as
