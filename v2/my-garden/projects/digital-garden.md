###

This website where you're currently reading the content is my digital garden. I started working on it last year in December (2023). My initial motivation was to have an online space where I can document my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I wanted to have a place where I can share my knowledge and experiences with the world.

####

> I am a little obsessed with documenting stuff and so having this space made perfect sense to me.

### Tech Stack

This website is mainly built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I chose Next.js because I wanted to learn how the SSR works and I wanted to try and maximize the performance of the website.

####

I wrote a detailed [blog](https://www.tarat.space/writings/nextjs-homepage-faster) on how I used *Partial Pre Rendering* and React `Suspense` to minimize the first load time of this page.

So since I already have that blog I am not gonna do a lot of talking abt this project. Thanks for reading!!
