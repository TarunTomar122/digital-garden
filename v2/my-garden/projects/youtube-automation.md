This unarguably is one of the most fun projects I got to work on. So the story goes like this...

####

I was streaming on youtube (Yes, I do that sometimes) and somebody in the chat randomly pulled up this idea that I should automate my youtube shorts using my coding skills. I was like "Hmm, that's a cool idea" but I have no clue how to do that lmao.

#### The breakthrough

Few days later I hit the breakthrough when I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK-jh0QCoxc&ab_channel=BalladJukebox) and I was listening to the part where Em beihold starts singing and I noticed that the youtube timeline actually shows the most viewed parts of the video. I was like "Wait a minute, I can use this to automate my youtube shorts".

#### The idea

Now the idea was simple...All I had to do was to

####

- extract the most replayed part of the video.
- cut that part out.
- add subtitles to it.
- change the aspect ratio to 9:16.
- upload it to youtube.

####

So that's exactly what I did. I wrote a js script using pupeeter to download the html of the webpage and then I used a python script to process the html and extract the data of the bezier curves of the timeline. Then I used the bezier curves to extract the most viewed part of the video and then I used moviepy to cut that part out and add subtitles to it.

####

Subtitles were generated using the youtube api and the aspect ratio was changed using moviepy.

####

To upload the video to youtube I used the youtube api and the video was uploaded to my channel.

####

That's it. That was the whole process. Pretty simple but a lot of fun. Did you like it?
