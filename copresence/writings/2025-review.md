## context

I've used **Ali Abdal's wheel** of life for 2 years back to back to reflect on my year and today is 31st December 2025 so that's that's what this blog is gonna be about. 

But before I go too far ahead, let me take a step back and do a little revision on last year's scores in different categories.
Last year, I got a 9/10 overall and a perfect 10 in relationships category... so im excited to see how we did this year and oh yes I have a new category to add to this year's wheel so stick around till last for all that :)

## career and finances

This used to be my least favorite category of all time but things have changed over the last few years and i've gotten quite stable (touch wood) in my finances (or atleast that's how i like to think).

The first time I wrote a year end blog, I was in a lot of debt and had no idea about how to manage money. The second time, I was in a little bit of debt but I had just started saving some money and now this year... well this year was even better in that sense. 

**I paid off my education loan finally** which is a bigger deal to me than it should have been ig but it's good to be loan free for the first time in your adult life. Plus I did manage to invest more money this year than I have ever done and I also got promoted at work so that was helpful. 

Feels like I took a lot of baby steps into a stable adult life this year and I spent some money on myself and my loved ones  which is something that's very new to me. Early this year I went to the Coldplay Concert in Mumbai, then took a trip to kazakistan, went out with family/ordered in a couple of times and spent money in many other places (responsibily). That felt good and I would want to be able to continue doing that hehe.

Other than getting promoted at work, I did work on a lot of side projects this year and one of them even helped me earn my first internet money ([instafy.in](https://www.instafy.in), wink wink). My youtube channel gathered a lot of attention and that funneled down to other social platforms for me. One of my videos got over 35K views and then that in turn helped me put my first ever app on playstore ([lumi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumi.mobile&hl=en_IN))

Oh and remember how last year I wrote a blog about my confusion with what I want to do in future...([New job? Higher Studies? India? Europe?](https://www.tarat.space/writings/what-do-i-do)) Well this year I did a lot of progress on that front :) Yes!!! I am gonna take a break from work in late 2026 and go for my master's in some other country (I will share more when I've decided which one).

Overall I think this was the best year both in terms of finances and career for me so far and so I'll give it a perfect 10.

## 10/10

PS: It was a 9/10 last year.

### health and fitness

Okay so as usual I once again **did not** manage to gain weight. Contrary to that I ended up loosing a lot of weight lol. At the time of writing this blog, I am around 58Kgs which is 3Kgs less than last year :) 

If you're new here and are reading this, you might think that it's a good thing but NO. I am slightly underweight now and so fixing that is still gonna be a goal that will carry forward to 2026.

However other than that, I was extremely active throughout the year. I trained for and completed an ultramarathon, hit my PBs in other distances, did not indeed swim at all, but cycled a few times to office and worked out atleast 4 days every week. 

My mental health was also very stable this year (thanks to my relatively mature girlfriend and family lol). 

Oh and I became a die hard (pun intended) Bryan Johnson follower this year! Yuh that longevity guy. Let me tell you how hardcore I have been in the second half of this year. 

I barely ever ate junk food, my last meal was almost always atleast 4-6 hours before bedtime, I consistently went to bed at the same time, around 10PM everyday, I did not do any physically intense exercise or had coffee after 2PM all that to make sure my RHR was as low as possible and as a result I had the best sleep scores (did not measure, just guessing based on how I felt the next morning) of my entire life.

So yuhs I think it was an almost perfect year for this category. **Almost** perfect because I started most of these things in the second half of the year lol.

### relationships

Well well well... if it isn't everyone's favorite category to read about (i don't know im just guessing)... Unfortunately I don't have any masala for you this year (as usual). Monisha and I got to spend a lot of time together (in person) this year, 87 days to be precise, which is almost 3 months together and sure I could ask for more but that's already like twice as much as we did last year lol. Plus we were together on a lot of very important dates in our relationship, which made those dates even more enjoyable. We went to coldplay concert together, did a half marathon in kazakshtan on her bday, met each other's parents, spent christmas together and now are sitting next to each other writing our year end blogs!!! 

Apart from my romantic relationship, I think this year was great for my family and friend-ships too... Ofcs there are a few things in between that I would have wanted differently (like I did not get to meet Nana, Nani this year and only spent very few days with Dadi) but mostly it was fine. As for friends... Everytime I come to BLR I get to meet my college friends and that's all the meetings I want so it's all good!

I spent a lot of time with Pari this year and that has to be one of the highlights for 2025. We did a few paintings, played piano and evening football in park and I taught her EVS and English. So it's a perfect score right there.

Overall I'd say this year was a 9/10 for relationships. (took out 1 point cz I still feel I can do better on the family front)

### leisure and travel

Yes! It is a new cateogry that we didn't have until this year. The reason I added this category is because there were too many things I did which were my firsts.

I started this year by going to a coldplay concert in mumbai, then right after the concert we spent a couple of days in lunavla and after that I went to pune and met aashvi. Later on in April, Monisha came to Noida and we went to **Kazak** for an entire week. In may, we had the design team onsite in BLR which I extended to an entire month's stay (almost avoided Noida's hot weather). Later on I went to NYC for Spectrum Web onsite. Yus, I have to rewrite this again. **I went to NYC** and visiting another country is soo new and exciting that I have blogs for both of them which you should read btw. In an interesting turn of events my next stop after NYC was Patna, Bihar. **Yup, from NYC to Bihar in a single month.** Let that sink in. Oh and then we did our usual year end trip with office friends to Chail and then I went back to BLR where I attended Jacob Collier's Concert and then went to Kochi to see binnale and now I am back in BLR for the year end.

That was a lot... right? 

So I guess I have to give it a perfect 10 :)

### hobbies and interest

It's time for my year-end-self-brag paragraph... (**drum rolls**)

I ran an Ultramarathon, hiked Big Almaty Lake, got promoted at work, earned my first internet dollar, launched a todo app, got over 2000 subscribers on youtube, worked out consistently, taught fractions to Pari, ran my age in New York City, read more than 20 books, gave GRE and IELTS, attended Coldplay's Concert, ended up in Bihar for a week, got university acceptances, paid off my education loan, reconnected with old friends, cooked many recipes with Monisha and still managed to sleep at 10PM everyday.

## 10/10

### conclusion

Just a quick note, I intentionally kept this year's self-brag paragraph as one para unlike past because it looks better on instagram that way. Anyhow overall this was a great year and not it's time to get the average score... (**drum rolls, again!**)

## 10/10 

I rounded off the score and we have a perfect year for the first time in the history of writing these blogs (which is just 3 years including this one).

ok now an awkard end... bye!
