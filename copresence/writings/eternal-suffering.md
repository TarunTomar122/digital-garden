### The cycle of suffering

- Life is pretty dull and boring
- I create challenging goals to make it more interesting
- I start working towards those goals
- I am on the verge of burnout but I keep going thinking that I'll be happy and fulfilled when I achieve them
- I achieve them and I'm happy and fulfilled **(for like 2 seconds)**
- Then I realize life is still pretty dull and boring
- And so I create new challenges and the cycle continues
