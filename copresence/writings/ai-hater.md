Remember this statement from Dario (CEO of Anthropic)? I saw it sometime last year and I remember how stupid I thought this idea of AI writing 90% of my code was back then.

We had Claude 3.5 Sonnet at the time and even though it was super powerful (and was already writing half of my daily code), it was nowhere near replacing me as an engineer. Then Claude 4 came out in May and that was a big leap. Big enough that it got me questioning my role as a software developer.

Up until that moment, I was only relying on Claude for stupid side projects, easy bug fixes, or documentation updates. But with the release of Claude 4, I went through a fundamental shift in how I worked with these models. I went from using them like an intern to basically as a buddy with equal (if not more) coding capabilities. That was until Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 were released — which is a whole other thing on its own.

Fast forward to today, I barely ever touch raw code. I am almost always in the terminal prompting claude code or cursor agents to do things that used to take me weeks, if not months, to code.

"So where are we going with this?" — I asked myself one day. What is it that I, a human, bring to the table?

Now we have all heard various different answers to this question and generally they start with something super vague like: humans think while AI doesn't. Or something slightly less vague like: humans are better at creative tasks while AI is better at repetitive tasks.

At the start of this year, I was confident in my abilities... so much so that I believed I could plan better than AI and I could think of the bigger picture while AI couldn't. But as the year progressed, I started to see hints of examples where Claude or GPT-5 were doing better than me at those things.

They were not only able to plan better than me but also execute on those plans faster and more efficiently (which is something I'll never be able to compete with as a human).

I get tired when I switch between 3 different coding tasks but AI doesn't. 
My hands are sore after typing for 8 hours but AI doesn't have hands.
I have many, many off days when I don't feel as productive but AI never gets bored or demotivated.

You know how people would say that we are humans and that's just AI — it doesn't have feelings or real life experiences? Well... great! I think that's exactly what makes this tool extremely powerful.

> Today an AI model can do certain things better than us and then do it again tomorrow without complaining.

That's the superpower of AI. That's something that we as humans can never compete with and to be honest we don't even have to.

I hate the idea of people going nuts over AI taking away their jobs because to me that's like the best thing that could happen to us as a species. We are not meant to do JOBS! At least not all of us.

I know at least for me, I don't wanna do jobs. I wanna go for runs, play games, code what I feel like coding, cook some really tasty food, travel to new places, read more books, finish HIMYM, spend time with my girlfriend and so many other things.

Only if I can get AI to do all the work stuff for me...

> But if you don't have a job, how will you afford to live?

I don't know! I really don't. But I know for a fact that we will figure this out like we always have in the past. 

> But AI feels fundamentally different...

Ok listen, it's either just another tool or a super intelligent being.

If it's just another tool, then we are fine. We can use it to do things that we don't want to do and we can use it to do things that we don't know how to do and overall live a happier life. On the other hand, if it's a super intelligent being, then... Either it is nice and cute and we can be friends, in which case I suppose I can get away without working and won't have to worry about money. Or it's a terrible, terrible sentient and we all die.

In the end, us worrying about AI taking away our jobs is like the most useless thing we can bang our heads against the wall about. It's useless. 

What's more important is to realise that we're in the middle of a very interesting and exciting time where the human species is going through a fundamental shift in how we work and live and we are all going to be affected by it whether we like it or not. So instead of worrying about AI taking away our jobs, we can prolly use it to do things that we don't want to do in the meantime until it becomes AGI (if ever that happens).

### if you're still skeptical, do this

- Pick one annoying thing you do every week (emails, planning, code cleanup, docs, studying, whatever).
- Use AI for that one thing for 7 days.
- Judge it based on output + time saved.

If it doesn't help, fine — hate it.

But if it does help even a little bit, then congrats... you're not an AI hater anymore. You're just someone using a tool.

So stop being skeptical. It has already gotten much better than us at many things. If 2025 wasn't enough proof for you to become a believer, then 2026 will be.

Stop being an AI hater.
