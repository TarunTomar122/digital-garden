### 

Have you ever thought, “I wish that app existed”?
If yes, then keep reading—because I want to tell you why you should build that thing yourself.

####

You see, I’ve built more projects in the last 6 months than I did in the entire 4 years of my college. And I believe there’s a good reason for that.
No, I didn’t suddenly become a 10x engineer. And no, I didn’t give up my hobbies or social life.
**The reason is simple: AI and all the fancy tools we now have.**

####

Back then, I was writing 99% of the code myself. These days? Probably 20-30%.
The rest is written by AI.
And weirdly enough, writing less code has made me way faster. I’m able to build more things every day, in the same amount of time.

####

And my point is: if I can do this, **you can too.** 

####

> But what if I am not an engineer?

####

Perfect. You’re not an engineer. Should you still learn to use these AI tools to build things?
Absolutely yes.

####

AI is going to keep getting better at doing things for you. And if you’re not exploring it, using it, and learning from it now—you’ll be left behind.

####

If you wait to start learning AI until it’s already better than you, then my friend... you’re kinda screwed.
Yup. Seriously.
So instead of pretending you’re better than AI, embrace it. Use it. Learn from it.


####

And one of the easiest, most fun ways to learn? **Build things. Build that app you wish existed.**. Right now is the best time to start.

####

I do that too. I am making [a day planner and habit tracker app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumi.mobile), [an automated ai newsletter service for my stocks](https://stocksbrew.vercel.app/), [reels but for spotify](https://spotify-reels.netlify.app/), stupid fun games for my younger sister ([math munchies](https://taruntomar122.github.io/math-munchies/), [chidiya ud](https://taruntomar122.github.io/chidia-udd/), [english dictionary](https://taruntomar122.github.io/english-dictionary/) etc.), stupid fun apps for my girlfriend ([workout planner](https://taruntomar122.github.io/workout-planner/)) etc.

#### 

Some of these apps have real users and others are just for fun. But more importantly, I am building something every week. I am flooding the internet with my extremely specific and niche apps that I wish existed but either didn't or were not good enough.

####

And you should too.

####

Stop waiting. Start building.
Flood the internet with your own weird, wonderful, niche ideas.
