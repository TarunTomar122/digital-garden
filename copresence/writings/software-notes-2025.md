description: A year full of lessons and learnings

### 

2025 just ended and I want to talk about some things I learned last year as a software developer.

####

And some things I’m carrying forward into 2026.

####

I hope some of this is useful to you too. So, let's start.

---

### 1. Writing code became… optional?

At some point in 2025 I realized something weird:

####

**I almost never write code anymore.**

####

Most of my code is written by AI agents now.
Cursor agents. Claude Code. Whatever tool is good that week.

####

And no, I’m not saying I became a “prompt engineer” or a “10x engineer”.

####

I’m saying: the bottleneck moved.

####

Before 2025, my bottleneck (and maybe yours too) was obvious:
- writing code took time
- building a product took time
- shipping took time

####

But in 2025… it changed so drastically that I started feeling like:

####

> I can build almost anything I want to build.

####

And when you get that kind of power, the question changes.

####

It’s no longer: *“can I build it?”*

It’s: *“should I build it?”*

---

### 2. “Knowing what to build” became the real skill

Here’s the trap.

####

When MVPs become cheap, it becomes insanely easy to waste your life hopping between projects like a hyperactive squirrel.

####

One week it’s:
> “bro what if I build this…”

Next week it’s:
> “wait wait that idea is better…”

And then:
> “okay I’ll just ship both.”

####

And suddenly you’re 6 months older with 9 half-built products and 0 belief in any of them.

####

So 2025 taught me this:

####

> With AI, execution is cheap. Belief is expensive.

####

You *need* to first pick something you actually care about.
Something you’ll stick with even after the initial dopamine wears off.

####

For me, the “good” ideas were not world-changing.
They were just… meaningful *to me*.

####

Some examples from my year:
- **Lumi**: a to-do / day-planner type app I genuinely use.
- **StocksBrew**: an AI agent that tracks stock news and gives summaries before market open.
- **Instafy**: a tool I didn’t need daily, but I saw a small market moment and went for it.

####

And one of these gave me my first ever internet dollar.

####

That sounds tiny (and it is) but it changed something in my brain.

####

It proved that shipping small things consistently is not “random side projects”.

It’s reps.

---

### 3. Your personal brand is now non-negotiable

I’ve been saying this for a while and 2025 just screamed it in my face:

####

**It’s more important than ever to build a personal brand.**

####

Because now… everyone can ship.

####

Cursor exists.
Agents exist.
Cloud whatever exists.
18 year olds are launching products every weekend.

####

And you’ll see some launch and think:
> “bruh that idea isn’t even revolutionary. I could’ve built that.”

####

Yes. You could have.

####

But here’s the part most devs ignore:

####

> Distribution is a feature.

####

If you don’t have a list of people who trust you / like your work / want to see you win…
your product launches will feel like shouting into the void.

####

In 2025 I leaned harder into posting.
YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, my website — all of it.

####

I crossed **2,000 YouTube subscribers** last year. Thank you btw.

####

And then something funny happened.

####

One of my experiments I posted on my site, I tweeted about it, it popped off…

####

…and then **Google reposted** it.

####

Butterfly effect is real.
Small things snowball.

####

And suddenly I started getting collaboration opportunities from people I thought would never even notice me.

####

Not because I became smarter overnight.

But because I showed up consistently.

####

So in 2026, I’m investing even more into my brand.
Not in a cringe way.

In a “I want more doors to open” way.

####

If you’re not posting your work online, please start.
Even if it’s messy.
Even if it’s small.
Even if it’s “just a side project”.

####

Stop waiting. Start building. Start posting.

### 4. AI helped me go deep (not just ship fast)

This was a big one for me.

####

Before 2025, I *wanted* to do deeper stuff:
- research papers
- understanding LLMs
- building a transformer
- fine-tuning models
- messing with vision
- doing weird experiments

####

But if I’m being honest…

####

I never had the guts.

Or I always felt like I needed hand-holding.
Or I’d get stuck on some concept and then my motivation would die.

####

In 2025, AI became the hand-holding.

####

And because of that, I actually did the things I kept postponing for years.

####

I built my own transformer model.
I fine-tuned a model on a custom dataset.
I fine-tuned NanoChat.
I added vision to NanoChat (and that got a lot of attention online).

####

And I also started reading more papers.

####

Not because papers became easier.

But because now I could sit with ChatGPT/Claude and ask:
- “what does this term mean?”
- “explain this figure like I’m 5”
- “okay now explain it like I’m not 5”
- “what should I Google next?”

####

So yeah, AI didn’t just make me faster.

####

It made me braver.

####

And I want to keep doing that in 2026:
Use AI to ship, yes.

But also use it to learn aggressively.

---

### okay so what am I carrying into 2026?

If I had to compress 2025 into a few rules:

####

- **Build with belief**: ideas are cheap now. pick something you actually care about.
- **Brand is leverage**: ship in public. post. collect trust over time.
- **Go deep with AI**: use it as your tutor, not just your coder.

####

That’s it.

####

Now your turn:

####

> What did you learn in 2025? What are you carrying into 2026?

####

I’d genuinely love to know.

####

Chalo, bye!
