            We&apos;re prefetching all the links on this site. If you&apos;re on desktop, you&apos;ll notice that clicking through feels instantâ€”like pages are already loaded. This is because it&apos;s quietly loading every link in the background as you browse. It&apos;s a small trick that makes the whole experience feel snappier.

            This garden is never truly empty. If you open this site in multiple tabs (or someone else is browsing at the same time), you'll see soft, warm glows appear on the pageâ€”areas where other people's cursors are. It's a subtle way to feel the presence of others sharing this digital space with you. Open two tabs and move your mouse around to see it in action.

            The warmth you see isn't intrusive or distractingâ€”it's just a gentle reminder that this space is alive and shared. Multiple people create zones of accumulated heat, like collective attention painting the page.
