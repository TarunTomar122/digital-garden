### Why?

I'm going on my first ever international trip in april and this project is to help me do an overly specific thing. 

####

So basically, I was doing the trip planning with monisha and we were using figjam to put the places and restaurants on a screenshot of the map of the place where we were going to help us visualize the trip.

### Flow

As I said, it's overly specific but it was friday afternoon and work was slow so I built this app where you can basically put the place you're going to, number of days and some additional details if you want and it'll give you a map with all the places and restaurants marked on it.

And additionally, if you click on the place, it'll tell you basic stuff like why should you go there, what to do there, what to be aware of, how to reach there, etc. etc.

### In case you're intersted in THE HOW?

Very simple. 

I used claude sonnet 3.7 with cursor to write 100% of the code and gemini 2.0 flash to fill in the details based on your input.
