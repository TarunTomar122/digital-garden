### Why?

Like many people, I used to message myself on WhatsApp just to remember things — random to-dos, half-formed ideas, tiny notes to my future self.

But no matter how many productivity apps I tried, none of them stuck.
They always felt heavy. Too many steps. Too much clutter.

So I decided to build something just for myself — something frictionless.

And that's how Lumi was born.
