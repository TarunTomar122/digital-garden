###

This is basically jarvis on a command line interface. I chose to build it on the command line because I wanted to have a simple and fast way to interact with the assistant and it also make me feel like I am a hacker when I use it lol.

#### Tech Stack

I used RASA to build the NLP model and I used an express server to handle the backend. The express server is connected to a mongodb database where I store the user data and the logs of the assistant.

#### 

I trained the model on a dataset of over 1000 conversations and I used the rasa core to handle the conversation flow. 

####

- Rasa would decide the action based on the intent and the entities extracted from the user input.
- The action would then be sent to the express server where the action would be performed.
- The response would then be sent back to the user.

So that's how the assistant worked. Simple and straight forward.
