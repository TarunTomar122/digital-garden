### Why?

I have this weird habit of scrolling through reels while I work or when I am walking.. In those cases I am just listening to the songs in those reels and not actually watching them. But as you can imagine, it's not the best experience. 

####

So I thought why not build an app where I can basically scroll through songs like I do in reels.

####

And that's how this app came to life. Using a combination of nextjs, tailwindcss, last fm api and of course spotify api, I turned this stupid idea into a reality.

### Flow

It starts with you choosing a genre.

and then basically you just scroll through the songs. It supports three types of gestures.

####

1. Swipe left to get a random song.
2. Swipe right to get more songs from the same artist.
3. Swipe up to get more songs from the same genre. (with a 20-80 split between exploration and exploitation)

That's basically it. No rocket science, just a fun project to work on.
