### Why?

Every time I saw a photo with a perfect vibe — that soft lighting, film tone, or moody contrast — I’d wonder:
“How do I make my images look like that?”

Color grading apps felt complicated. Presets never looked right.
And recreating a style from scratch? Way too much work.

So I built something I actually wanted to use — a one-click way to transfer aesthetic.

That’s how Instafy was born.
