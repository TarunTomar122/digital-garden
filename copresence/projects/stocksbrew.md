### Why?

As someone who casually tracks stocks, I used to spend 20‚Äì30 minutes every morning jumping between Moneycontrol, Economic Times, Mint, and Twitter ‚Äî just to answer one simple question:

‚ÄúIs anything important happening with the stocks I care about today?‚Äù

It was noisy, repetitive, and not how I wanted to start my mornings.

So, over a weekend, I hacked together something for myself ‚Äî and called it StocksBrew.

### ‚òï What StocksBrew does

Collects fresh news from multiple financial sources

Filters for your selected stocks (or even from a screenshot of your portfolio)

Summarizes the updates using AI

Delivers a clean, readable newsletter to your inbox before the market opens

No noise. No clickbait. Just the news that actually matters.

### üåø Why I built it

I wanted to start my mornings informed ‚Äî not overwhelmed.
Now, instead of scrolling through five tabs, I just check one email.

It's still early, but around 50 people are already using it daily to track their portfolios.
It's free for now while I figure out where to take it next.
