### Why?

As someone who casually tracks stocks, I used to spend 20–30 minutes every morning jumping between Moneycontrol, Economic Times, Mint, and Twitter — just to answer one simple question:

“Is anything important happening with the stocks I care about today?”

It was noisy, repetitive, and not how I wanted to start my mornings.

So, over a weekend, I hacked together something for myself — and called it StocksBrew.

### ☕ What StocksBrew does

Collects fresh news from multiple financial sources

Filters for your selected stocks (or even from a screenshot of your portfolio)

Summarizes the updates using AI

Delivers a clean, readable newsletter to your inbox before the market opens

No noise. No clickbait. Just the news that actually matters.

### 🌿 Why I built it

I wanted to start my mornings informed — not overwhelmed.
Now, instead of scrolling through five tabs, I just check one email.

It's still early, but around 50 people are already using it daily to track their portfolios.
It's free for now while I figure out where to take it next.
